# Collection of my Ruby projects
```shell
Hello, my name is Ruslan and I wanted to learn ruby.
In this repository you can find all ruby projects that I made.
I'm also trying to learn how to properly use git and document my code so suggestions are welcomed.

Additional credit goes to my professor who inspired me to learn this beautiful language.
